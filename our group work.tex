\section{Introduction:}
Farming is one of the Ugandans most prominent sources of income. However, most farmers do not keep any records while those who are not familiar with the modern computing technology keep track of their records manually for example by taking notes in their books of account to make an accountability though this method has been used for many years, it is not efficient, is very time consuming and records are likely to get lost or destroyed. the solution to this problem would be an automated record keeping system which is in form of a database.
Good farmer is a website that allows any poultry farmer all over the country who has access to the internet to create an account. in so doing, a database is created and it allows a farmer to make entries, store vie and update records each time he/she visits the website.
